* Lesson
    * Basic concepts: gismu/cmavo
        * Talk very briefly about consonant-vowel rules (CVCCV, CCVCV, etc.)?
        * Case insensitiveness
    * Basic concepts: jufra/bridi/selbri/sumti
        * Definitions
            * Explain that tenses are optional
            * Explain "mi" and "do"
            * Explain "ti" and "ta"
        * Examples in English
        * Examples in Lojban
            * Implicit places (zo'e)
            * Observatives
                * Do not use the term "observative", though
                * There are no exercises about them yet...
                  * TODO: bridi/jufra exercises can emcompass observatives
            * Zo'e
                * Skipping around
                * Ellisis: first term or last terms
            * Variant bridi structure
                * more than one sumti before the selbri
                * no sumti before the selbri
        * Syntax tree
            * selbri as root and sumti as children
            * edges labeled "x1", "x2", ...
* New exercises
    * Given a word, tell its grammatical class (gismu, cmavo) (OK)
    * Given an English sentence, choose "bridi and jufra" or "only jufra" (OK)
    * Given a Lojban sentence, choose "bridi and jufra" or "only bridi" (OK)
    * Given a bridi, identify its selbri (OK)
    * Given a bridi, tell its place structure (OK)
        * Example: "Select the x2", "Select the listener"
        * This can also be used for sentences that are not automatically generated, and this is very useful for vocabulary lessons
    * Translations from English to Lojban (OK)
