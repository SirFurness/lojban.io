* Lesson
    * Basic concepts: gismu/cmavo
        * Talk very briefly about consonant-vowel rules (CVCCV, CCVCV, etc.)?
        * Case insensitiveness
    * Basic concepts: jufra/bridi/selbri/sumti
        * Implicit places (zo'e)
        * Observatives
            * Do not use the term "observative", though
            * There are no exercises about them yet...
              * TODO: bridi/jufra exercises can emcompass observatives
        * Zo'e
            * Skipping around
            * Ellisis: first term or last terms
        * Variant bridi structure
            * more than one sumti before the selbri
            * no sumti before the selbri
* New exercises
    * Given a word, tell its grammatical class (gismu, cmavo) (OK)
