### Description sumti

Okay, so now we know how to use _"prenu"_ as a selbri, and this lets us express sentences such as _"I am a person"_ (_mi prenu_).
But how can we say _"I am talking to a person"_?
For that, we would need _"prenu"_ to act as a sumti.

This is achieved by using the words _"lo"_ and _"ku"_, as in the following examples.

|Sentence|Translation|
|--------|------|
|mi tavla lo prenu ku|I am talking to a person.|
|mi dunda lo mlatu ku do|I give the cat to you.|
|lo zdani ku pelxu|The house is yellow.|
|mi tavla lo dunda ku|I am talking to the donor.|

You simply place a selbri between these two words, and it takes anything that can fill the _x1_ of that selbri and turns it into a sumti.
So while _prenu_ means _"is a person"_, _lo prenu ku_ means _"someone who is a person"_, or simply _a person / the person_.
Similarly, _lo mlatu ku_ means _"something which is a cat"_, or simply _a cat_ / _the cat_.
And _lo dunda ku_ means _"someone who donates/is donating"_, or _a donor_ / _the donor_.

It is now time for you to attempt a few more translations.
You will need the following definitions:

<span class="definition-head">ctuca</span> x1 teaches audience x2 ideas/methods/lore x3 (du'u) about subject(s) x4 by method x5 (event)

<span class="definition-head">nelci</span> x1 is fond of/likes/has a taste for x2 (object/state)

<span class="definition-head">gerku</span> x1 is a dog/canine/[bitch] of species/breed x2

<span class="definition-head">melbi</span> x1 is beautiful/pleasant to x2 in aspect x3 (ka) by aesthetic standard x4

First, translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Translation|
|--------|-----------|
|lo gerku ku melbi|<span class="spoiler-answer">The dog is beautiful.</span>|
|lo ctuca ku nelci lo mlatu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">The teacher likes cats.</span>|
|mi dunda lo pelxu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">I donated something yellow.</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Translation|
|--------|-----------|
|You are teaching the dog.|<span class="spoiler-answer">do ctuca lo gerku ku</span>|
|The cat is beautiful.|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo mlatu ku melbi</span>|
|I like the teacher.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nelci lo ctuca ku</span>|
