### Bridi and jufra

**Bridi** is the most central unit of Lojban utterances. The concept is very close to what we call a proposition in English. A bridi is a claim that some objects stand in a relation to each other, or that an object has some property. This stands in contrast to **jufra**, which are merely utterances, which can be bridi or anything else being said. The difference between a bridi and a jufra is that a jufra does not necessarily state anything, while a bridi does. Thus, a bridi might be true or false, while not all jufra can be said to be such.

To have some examples (in English, to begin with), _Mozart was the greatest musician of all time_ is a bridi, because it makes a claim with a truth value, and it involves an object, Mozart, and a property, being the greatest musician of all time. On the contrary, _Ow! My toe!_ is not a bridi, since it does not involve a relation, and thus does not state anything. Both, though, are jufra.

Try to identify the bridi among these English jufra:

1. I hate it when you do that.
2. Woah, that looks delicious!
3. Geez, not again.
4. No, I own three cars
5. Nineteen minutes past eight.
6. This Saturday, yes.

Answers: <span class="spoiler-answer">
1, 2 and 4 are bridi. The rest contain no relation or claim of a property.

Put in Lojban terms, a bridi consists of one selbri, and one or more sumti. The selbri is the relation or claim about the object, and the sumti are the objects which are in a relation. Note that object is not a perfect translation of sumti, since sumti can refer to not just physical objects, but also purely abstract things like "The idea of warfare". A better translation would be something like "subject, direct or indirect object" for sumti, and main verb for selbri, though, as we will see, this is not optimal either.

We can now write the first important lesson down: **bridi = selbri + one or more sumti**.

Identify the sumti and selbri equivalents in these English jufra:

1. I will pick up my daughters with my car.
    * Answer: <span class="spoiler-answer">selbri: pick up (with) &mdash; sumti: I, my daughters, my car</span>
2. He bought 5 new shirts from Mark for just two hundred euro!
    * Answer: <span class="spoiler-answer">selbri: bought (from) (for) &mdash; sumti: He, 5 new shirts, Mark and two hundred euros<Paste></span>
3. So far, the EPA has done nothing about the amount of sulphur dioxide.
    * Answer: <span class="spoiler-answer">selbri: has done (about) &mdash; sumti: The EPA, nothing and the amount of sulphur dioxide</span>

### Constructing simple bridi
Now let's try making some Lojban bridi.
For this we will need some words to act as selbri:

<span class="definition-head">dunda</span> x_1 gives x_2 to x_3 (without payment)

<span class="definition-head">pelxu</span> x_1 is yellow

<span class="definition-head">zdani</span> x_1 is a home of x_2

Notice that these words meaning _give_, _yellow_ and _home_ would be considered a verb, an adjective and a noun in English.
In Lojban, there are no such categories and no such distinction.
**dunda** can be translated as _gives_ (verb), _is a giver_ (noun), _is giving_ (adjective) as well as to an adverb form.
They all act as selbri, and are used in the same way.

We will also need a few words to act as sumti:

<span class="definition-head">mi</span> "I" or "we" &ndash; the one or those who are speaking

<span class="definition-head">ti</span> "this" &ndash; some thing(s) or event(s) near the speaker(s), possibly pointed to by them

<span class="definition-head">do</span> "you" &ndash; the one or those who are being spoken to

<span class="definition-head">ta</span> "that" &ndash; some thing(s) or event(s) near the listener(s), possibly pointed to by them

See the strange translations of the selbri above &ndash; especially the x_1, x_2 and x_3?
Those are called sumti places.
They are places where sumti can go to fill a bridi.
Filling a sumti in a place states that the sumti fits in that place.
The second place of _dunda_, for example, x_2, is the thing being given.
The third is the object which receives the thing.
Notice also that the translation of _dunda_ has the word _to_ in it.
This is because, while this word is needed in English to signify the receiver, the receiver is in the third sumti place of _dunda_.
So when you fill the third sumti place of _dunda_, the sumti you fill in is always the receiver, and you don't need an equivalent to the word _to_!

To say a bridi, you simply say the first sumti (x_1), then the selbri, then any other sumti (x_2, x_3 and so on).

Usual bridi: _(x1 sumti) (selbri) (x2 sumti) (x3 sumti) (x4 sumti) (x5 sumti) (and so on)_

So, how would you say the following sentences in Lojban?

|Sentence|Translation|
|--------|------|
|This is a home of me.|<span class="spoiler-answer">ti zdani mi</span>|
|You give this to me.|<span class="spoiler-answer">do dunda ti mi</span>|

Now, how would you translate the following sentences into English?

|Sentence|Translation|
|--------|------|
|ti pelxu|<span class="spoiler-answer">This is yellow.</span>|
|ta zdani do|<span class="spoiler-answer">That is a home of you / That is your house.</span>|
|mi dunda ti do|<span class="spoiler-answer">I give this to you.</span>|

Quite easy once you get the hang of it, right?
