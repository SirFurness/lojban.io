Now let's turn to constructing our first sentences in Lojban.

**lo mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
_Cats drink milk._

One of your first thoughts might be "Where are nouns and verbs in Lojban?"

Here are three verbs:

**pinxe** means _drinks, to drink_.

**mlatu** means _is a cat, are cats, to be a cat_.

**ladru** means _is some milk_.

To turn a verb into a noun we put a short word **lo** in front of it: **lo mlatu**, **lo ladru**.

It might sound strange how _cat_ and _milk_ can be verbs but in fact this makes Lojban very simple:

verb

noun

**pinxe** - _to drink_

**lo pinxe** - _drinkers_

**mlatu** - _are cats, is a cat_

**lo mlatu** - _cats_

**ladru** - _is some milk_

**lo ladru** - _milk_

We can also say that **lo** creates a noun from a verb with roughly the meaning of _those who do..._ (_drink_ - _drinkers_), _those who are..._ (_are cats_ - _cats_) or _one which is..._ (_is some milk_ - _milk)._

The most basic sentence in Lojban consists of one phrase otherwise called _clause_. Clause has the following parts from the left to the right:

- the head of the clause: one or more nouns. The noun **lo mlatu** in this case.
- the head separator **cu** (remember that **c** is pronounced as _sh_)
- the tail of the clause: the main verb (**pinxe**) with possibly one or more nouns after it: the noun **lo ladru** in this case.

One more example:

**lo plise cu kukte**  
_Apples are tasty._

Here, **lo plise** means _apples_, **kukte** means _to be tasty_.

A simpler clause in Lojban would contain only one main verb:

**karce**  
_Car!_

You could say this when you see a car coming. Here the context would be clear enough that there is a car somewhere around and probably it's dangerous.

**karce** itself is a verb meaning _is a car, to be a car_.

Similarly, you can say

**carvi**  
_It is raining._

where

**carvi** = _is rain, to be raining_

or

**pluka**  
_It's pleasant_

where

**pluka** = _to be pleasant_

Notice that in Lojban there is no need in the word _it_ in such sense. You just use the verb you need.

**prami**  
_Someone loves._

where **prami** - _to love (someone)_

**bajra**  
_Someone runs._

where **bajra** - _to run_.

Again context would probably tell who loves whom and who runs.

Lojban does not require any punctuation, separate words are used instead. Punctuation marks like _! ? " "_ can be used for stylistic purposes or to make the text look smarter. They don't add or change the meaning. Note that the symbol **.** (dot) can be used as we use dot in English (i.e. as a punctuation mark) but its main purpose in Lojban is that it is a proper letter that denotes a pause.
