### Description sumti

Okay, so now we know how to use _prenu_ as a selbri, and this lets us express sentences such as "I am a person" (_mi prenu_).
But how can we say "I am talking to a person"?
For that, we would need _prenu_ to act as a sumti.

This is achieved by using the words _lo_ and _ku_, as in the following examples.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|mi tavla lo prenu ku|I am talking to a person.|
|mi dunda lo mlatu ku do|I give the cat to you.|
|lo zdani ku pelxu|The house is yellow.|
|mi tavla lo dunda ku|I am talking to the donor.|

You simply place a selbri between these two words, and it takes anything that can fill the _x1_ of that selbri and turns it into a sumti.
So while _prenu_ means "is a person", _lo prenu ku_ means "someone who is a person", or simply _a person / the person_.
Similarly, _lo mlatu ku_ means "something which is a cat", or simply _a cat_ / _the cat_.
And _lo dunda ku_ means "someone who donates/is donating", or _a donor_ / _the donor_.

It is now time for you to attempt a few more translations.
You will need the following definitions:

<span class="definition-head">ctuca</span> x_1 teaches audience x_2 ideas/methods/lore x_3 (du'u) about subject(s) x_4 by method x_5 (event).

<span class="definition-head">nelci</span> x_1 is fond of/likes/has a taste for x_2 (object/state).

<span class="definition-head">gerku</span> x_1 is a dog/canine/[bitch] of species/breed x_2.

<span class="definition-head">melbi</span> x_1 is beautiful/pleasant to x_2 in aspect x_3 (ka) by aesthetic standard x_4.

First, translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|lo gerku ku melbi|<span class="spoiler-answer">The dog is beautiful.</span>|
|lo ctuca ku nelci lo mlatu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">The teacher likes cats.</span>|
|mi dunda lo pelxu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">I donated something yellow.</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|You are teaching the dog.|<span class="spoiler-answer">do ctuca lo gerku ku</span>|
|The cat is beautiful.|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo mlatu ku melbi</span>|
|I like the teacher.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nelci lo ctuca ku</span>|

### Skipping places

There are several ways to play around with the order of the sumti inside the bridi.
The easiest one is by using the words _fa_, _fe_, _fi_, _fo_ and _fu_.

<span class="definition-head">fa</span> Tags the following sumti as filling x_1.

<span class="definition-head">fe</span> Tags the following sumti as filling x_2.

<span class="definition-head">fi</span> Tags the following sumti as filling x_3.

<span class="definition-head">fo</span> Tags the following sumti as filling x_4.

<span class="definition-head">fu</span> Tags the following sumti as filling x_5.

Notice that the vowels are the five vowels in the Lojban alphabet in order.
Using one of these words marks that the next sumti will fill the x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 and x_5 respectively.
The next sumti after that will be presumed to fill a slot one greater than the previous.

To use an example: _dunda fa do fe ti do_ &ndash; Giving by you of this thing to you. _fa_ marks the x1, the giver, which is "you". _fe_ marks the thing being given, the x_2, which is "this".
Sumti counting then continues from _fe_, meaning that the last sumti fills x_3, the object receiving.

|Sentence|Equivalent sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
|fe mi zdani|<span class="spoiler-answer">zdani mi</span>|<span class="spoiler-answer">Something is a home to me.</span>|
|mi tavla fi do|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi tavla zo'e do</span>|<span class="spoiler-answer">I was talking about you.</span>|
|mi fi do tavla|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi tavla zo'e do</span>|<span class="spoiler-answer">I was talking about you.</span>|

### Reordering sumti

There is another mechanism for reordering sumti, which is also very useful for making description-like sumti (the kind of sumti with _lo_ and _ku_).
Consider the sentence "I ate the gift", which might be appropriate if that gift is an apple.
To translate this, it would seem natural to look up a selbri meaning "gift" before continuing.
However, if one looks carefully at the definition of _dunda_, "x_1 gives x_2 to x_3", one realizes that the x_2 of _dunda_ is something given &ndash; a gift.

So, to express that sentence, we can't say _mi citka lo dunda ku_, because _lo dunda ku_ would be the x_1 of _dunda_, which is the donor of the gift.
Cannibalism aside, we don't want to say that.
What we want is a way to extract the x_2 of a selbri.

This is one example where it is useful to use the word _se_.
What _se_ does is to modify a selbri such that the x_1 and x_2 of that selbri trade places.
The construct _se + selbri_ is considered one selbri on its own.

<span class="definition-head">dunda</span> x_1 gives x_2 to x_3 (without payment).

<span class="definition-head">se dunda</span> x_2 gives x_1 to x_3 (without payment).

<span class="definition-head">se dunda</span> x_1 is given from x_2 to x_3 (without payment).

Let's try with ordinary sentences:

<div class="translation-source">
ti se dunda mi (= mi dunda ti)
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
This was donated by me. (= I donated this.)
</div>

<div class="translation-source">
mi nelci lo se dunda ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I like the gift.
</div>

Often, but not always, bridi with _se_-constructs are translated to sentences in the passive voice, since the x_1 is often the object performing the action.

_se_ has its own family of words.
Each of them swap a different place with the x_1.

|  |                |
|--|----------------|
|se|swap x_1 and x_2|
|te|swap x_1 and x_3|
|ve|swap x_1 and x_4|
|xe|swap x_1 and x_5|

Note that _s_, _t_, _v_, and _x_ are consecutive consonants in the Lojban alphabet.
