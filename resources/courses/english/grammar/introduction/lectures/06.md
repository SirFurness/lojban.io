### Abstractions

So far we have only expressed single sentences one at a time.
To express more complex things, however, you often need subordinate sentences.
Luckily, these are much easier in Lojban than what one would expect.

We will begin with an example to demonstrate this:

<span class="hspace" /> _I am happy that you are my friend._

Here, the main bridi is "I am happy that X" and the sub-bridi is "you are my friend".
Let's look at the definition for the word "happy" in Lojban:

<span class="definition-head">gleki</span> x1 is happy/gay/merry/glad/gleeful about x2 (event/state).

We can see that _gleki_ requires x_2 to be an event or a state.
This is natural, because one cannot be happy about an object in itself, only about some state the object is in.
But alas!
Only bridi can express a state or an event, and only sumti can fill the x_2 of gleki!

As you might have guessed, there is a solution.
The words **su'u...kei** have the function of converting bridi into selbri (similarly to how **lo...ku** converts selbri into sumti).

<span class="definition-head">su'u</span> generalized abstractor &ndash; x_1 is {bridi} as a non-specific abstraction of type x_2.

<span class="definition-head">kei</span> end abstraction.

So "X su'u do pendo mi kei" would mean "X is (a non-specific abstraction of) you being my friend".
It's usually hard to find good uses of a bridi as a selbri.
However, since "su'u BRIDI kei" is a selbri, one can convert it to a sumti using **lo...ku**:

<div class="translation-source">
mi gleki lo su'u do pendo mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I am happy that you are my friend.
</div>

<div class="translation-source">
mi djuno lo su'u do nelci lo mlatu ku kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I know that you like cats.
</div>

<div class="translation-source">
do ctuca mi lo su'u lo mlatu ku pendo kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
You taught me that cats are friendly.
</div>

### Specialized abstractors

In practice, **su'u...kei** does not see much use.
People prefer to use the more specific words **nu...kei** and **du'u...kei**.
They work the same way, but mean something more specific.
For example, **nu...kei** treats the bridi in between as an event or state, while **du'u...kei** treats it as an abstract predicate, for expressing things like ideas, thoughts or truths.
All these words (except _kei_) are called abstractors.
There are many of them, and only a few are used much.
Since **su'u...kei** is a general abstractor, it will work in all cases &ndash; but be careful: if context is not sufficiently clear, the listener may have trouble figuring out precisely what you mean.

<span class="definition-head">nu</span> generalized event abstractor &ndash; x_1 is a state/process/achievement/activity of {bridi}.

<span class="definition-head">du'u</span> predication/bridi abstractor &ndash; x_1 is the predication of {bridi}, as expressed in sentence x_2.

#### Event/state abstractors

From the definition, we see that _nu_ is indeed appropriate for events and state abstrations, and so it may be used with _gleki_ to indicate happiness about the **state** of _you being my friend_.

<div class="translation-source">
mi gleki lo nu do pendo mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I am happy that you are my friend.
</div>

Similarly, it could be used to indicate happiness about the **event** of _you donating me the cat_.

<div class="translation-source">
mi gleki lo nu do dunda lo mlatu ku mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I am happy that you donated the cat to me.
</div>

#### Predication abstractors

On the other hand, we see that _du'u_ is appropriate for predication abstractions.
For example, it may be used with _djuno_ to indicate knowledge about the **predication** that _you are my friend_.

<div class="translation-source">
mi djuno lo du'u do pendo mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I know that you are my friend.
</div>

<div class="translation-source">
mi djuno lo du'u do dunda lo mlatu ku mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I know that you donated the cat to me.
</div>


#### Indirect quotation

If you look carefully at the definition of _du'u_, you will notice that, besides the abstract predication itself (x_1), it also has a second sumti place for the text of the predication (x_2).
Hence, "X se du'u do pendo mi kei" means "X is the text corresponding to the predication of you being my friend".

This is often used for indirect quotation.
For a concrete example, let's use the word _cusku_:

<span class="definition-head">cusku</span> x_1 (agent) expresses/says x_2 (sedu'u/text/lu'e concept) for audience x_3 via expressive medium x_4.

<div class="translation-source">
mi cusku lo se du'u do pendo mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I said that you are my friend.
</div>

<div class="translation-source">
mi cusku lo se du'u do dunda lo mlatu ku mi kei ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I said that you donated the cat to me.
</div>

It may be helpful to memorize "se du'u" as a single construct, which indicates that what follows is an indirect quotation, instead of always mentally decomposing it into _se + du'u_.
Indeed, some people even write "lo sedu'u" instead of "lo se du'u".
This is allowed, since "se" and "du'u" are cmavo ("structure words") and in Lojban it is valid to concatenate arbitrary sequences of cmavo together, without spaces, as if they were a single word.
We will learn more about the morphological classes later.

<!--### Remark-->

<!--Consider the word _nupre_:-->

<!--<span class="definition-head">nupre</span> x1 (agent) promises/commits/assures/threatens x2 (event/state) to x3 [beneficiary/victim].-->

### Exercises

It's now time for you to attempt a few more translations.
You will need the following new word:

<span class="definition-head">nupre</span> x1 (agent) promises/commits/assures/threatens x2 (event/state) to x3 [beneficiary/victim].

Translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|do nupre lo nu tavla mi kei ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">You promised that (you) would talk to me.</span>|
|do cusku lo sedu'u mi nelci lo mlatu ku kei ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">You said that I like cats.</span>|
|mi gleki lo nu lo zdani ku pelxu kei ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">I am happy that the house is yellow.</span>|
|xu do djuno lo du'u lo prenu ku ctuca lo gerku ku kei ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">Did you know that people teach dogs?</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|Did you say that the cat is beautiful?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu do cusku lo sedu'u lo mlatu ku melbi kei ku</span>|
|I am glad that you taught me.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi gleki lo nu do ctuca mi kei ku</span>|
|What do you know that I did?|<span class="spoiler-answer">do djuno lo du'u mi mo kei ku</span>|
|What did you promise that you would donate to me?|<span class="spoiler-answer">do nupre lo nu do dunda ma mi kei ku <br/> _[or]_ do nupre lo nu dunda ma mi kei ku</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button near the top of the page!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
