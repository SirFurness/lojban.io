### Three Brivla Tanru

It was learned how make simple tanrus of two briva. How about three or four?

Let's have an example, taken from the Lojban Reference Grammar.

Consider the phrase: *Little Girls’ School*. What does it mean? Depends on where we place the parenthesis.
 * (Little Girls’) School  -- A school for little-girls. That is, a school for girls who are little.
 * Little (Girls’ School)  -- A little-school for girls. That is, a little school for girls.

What is little attached to? Is the school little? Or is the girls little?
In lojban, one cannot to have such ambiguity!
How to translate both cases to Lojban?


### The BO connector.

<span class="definition-head">cmalu</span> x_1 is small in property/dimension(s) x_2 (ka) as compared with standard/norm x_3.  (event/state).

<span class="definition-head">nixli</span> x_1 is a girl [young female person] of age x_2 immature by standard x_3  (event/state).

<span class="definition-head">ckule</span> x_1 is school/institute/academy at x_2 teaching subject(s) x_3 to audien./commun. x_4 operated by x5. .  (event/state).


|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|cmalu nixli **bo** ckule| Little (girl school) | A little school for girls |
|cmalu **bo** nixli ckule| (Little girl) school | A school for little girls |
|cmalu nixli ckule| (Little girl) school | A school for little girls |

If the connector were left out, the standard way to interpret is by a left-to-right reading:
**cmalu** immediately influences **nixli**, and then,
**cmalu nixli** immediately influences **ckule**.


### Four Brivla Tanru
Consider the phrase: *Pretty Little Girls’ School*, again taken from the Lojban Reference Grammar.

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|melbi cmalu nixli ckule| (Pretty little) girl school | A school for girls that are beautifully small |
|melbi **bo** cmalu nixli ckule| (Pretty little) girl school | A school for girls that are beautifully small |
|melbi cmalu **bo** nixli ckule| Pretty (little girl) school | A school for small girls who are beautiful|
|melbi cmalu nixli **bo** ckule| Pretty little (girl school) | A girls' school which is beautifully small |
|melbi cmalu **bo** nixli **bo** ckule| Pretty [(little girl) school] | A small school for girls which is beautiful|

Notice that, no **bo** constructs reads from left to right, while with multipole **bo** constructs, one must read from right to left.
