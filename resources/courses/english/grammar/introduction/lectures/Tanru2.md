### Three Brivla Tanru

It was learned how make simple tanrus of two briva. How about three or four?

Let's have an example, taken from the Lojban Reference Grammar.

Consider the phrase: *Little Girls’ School*. What does it mean? Depends on where we place an imaginary parenthesis.
 * (Little Girls’) School  -- A school for little-girls. That is, a school for girls who are little.
 * Little (Girls’ School)  -- A little-school for girls. That is, a little school for girls.

What is little attached to? Is the school little? Or are the girls little?
In lojban, one cannot to have such ambiguity!
How to translate both cases to Lojban?


### The BO connector.

<span class="definition-head">cmalu</span> x_1 is small in property/dimension(s) x_2 (ka) as compared with standard/norm x_3.

<span class="definition-head">nixli</span> x_1 is a girl [young female person] of age x_2 immature by standard x_3.

<span class="definition-head">ckule</span> x_1 is school/institute/academy at x_2 teaching subject(s) x_3 to audien./commun. x_4 operated by x5.


|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|cmalu nixli **bo** ckule| Little (girl school) | A little school for girls |
|cmalu **bo** nixli ckule| (Little girl) school | A school for little girls |

A way to think about it, is to imagine a parenthesis around the **bo** connector surrounding the two selbri.

Another way to think about it, is imagining the **bo** as making a direct connection/biding between the selbris, like a bridge.
The reason why, some people say **bo** binds two selbri strongly.

If the connector were left out, the standard way to interpret is by a left-to-right reading:
**cmalu** immediately influences **nixli**, and then,
**cmalu nixli** immediately influences **ckule**.

If there are multiple **bo** connectors, then, one should read them right-to-left.

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|cmalu **bo** nixli **bo** ckule| Little (girl school) | A little school for girls |
|cmalu nixli ckule| (Little girl) school | A school for little girls |


### The Lojbanic boys' school.
Let's practice this by means of another example.

<span class="definition-head">nanla</span> x_1 is a boy/lad [young male person] of age x_2 immature by standard x_3.

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|lojbo nanla **bo** ckule| Lojbanic (boy school) | A lojbanic school for boys |
|lojbo **bo** nanla ckule| (Lojbanic boy) school | A school for lojbanic boys |
|lojbo nanla ckule| (Lojbanic boy) school | A school for lojbanic boys |
|lojbo **bo** nanla **bo** ckule| Lojbanic (boy school) | A lojbanic school for boys |

Therefore, while **lojbo nanla bo ckule** is a school for boys which (presumably) teaches lojban,
we have that **lojbo nanla ckule** is a school (which presumably teaches anything), but only for lojbanic boys.

Again, imaginary parenthesis are placed around the first **bo**, in a right-to-left reading. Otherwise, left-to-right parenthesis are the standard.


### Never forget: It is still a tanru! -- Important American Computers.
Because the examples above, one can easily forget that we are dealing with a tanru here.
**nanla ckule** was translated as a boy school, because presumably the students are boys, but, that is not required.
The only thing that matters, is that it is a **ckule** somehow related to **nanla**. Perhaps the boys are students.
But, perhaps the teachers are boys, or, perhaps the school building has a boy shape.
The relation, is thus not clear, and must be guessed from context (if one can).

Therefore, let us revise the translations from above:

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|lojbo nanla **bo** ckule| Lojbanic (boy school) | A lojbanic-type-of (boy-type-of school) |
|lojbo nanla ckule| (Lojbanic boy) school | A (lojbanic-type-of boy)-type of school |


Let's try another example: **vajni merko skami**, meaning, important-american-computers. How can one interpret that tanru?
Before going forward, try to think about it your own.

Alright! Assuming you've tried, as it is, the association is done from left to right. Therefore, **merko** is **vjani**-like.
And thus, **skami** is **vajni merko**-like, that is, **skami** is (**merko** which is **vjani**-like)-like.

Possible translations for **vajni merko skami**, therefore, include:
 * These are computers of/for (an) important american (people/person).
 * These are american computers, in the sense of, computers manufactured by important american company.
 * These are computers are somehow american-related, and the american-relation of them is important.


Now, it all changes with: **vajni merko bo skami**.
Now, **merko** and **skami** are binded together.
Possible translations therefore, include:
 * These are computers of/for (an) american (people/person), but the computers themselves are important (not the americans).
 * These are american computers, in the sense of, computers manufactured by american company, but the computers themselves are important.
 * These computers are somehow american-related, but these american-related-computer themselves are important, not the american-relation.

It is interesting that both **vajni merko bo skami** and **vajni merko skami**,
can be translated as *important american computers*, or *computers of/for americans, which is important*. 
The difference between the phrases about the presence or absence of **bo**, is whether the computers themselves are important, or wether the american-relation which is the important thing.

The translation table:

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|vajni merko skami| (Important american) computers | An (important-type-of american relationship)-type of computer |
|vajni merko **bo** skami| Important (american computers) | An important-type-of (american-related computers) |


### Exercises!
Wow. Subtle thing. Take it easy. Calm down. Breath. Perhaps eat a cookie.
Now it is your turn. Try to translate these, being precise, and non-ambiguous.

<!--- To consider remove the four brivla tanru from here. It may be too complex. --->
<!--- BUT.. Tanru 3 should be more than 'bo' right? Then, maybe to insert here as curiosity? --->
### Curiosity: Four Brivla Tanru
Consider the phrase: *Pretty Little Girls’ School*, again taken from the Lojban Reference Grammar.

|Sentence|Translation|Meaning|
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|melbi cmalu nixli ckule| [(Pretty little) girl] school | A school for girls that are beautifully small |
|melbi **bo** cmalu nixli ckule| [(Pretty little) girl] school | A school for girls that are beautifully small |
|melbi cmalu **bo** nixli ckule| [Pretty (little girl)] school | A school for small girls who are beautiful|
|melbi cmalu nixli **bo** ckule| [Pretty little] (girl school) | A girls' school which is beautifully small |
|melbi cmalu **bo** nixli **bo** ckule| Pretty [little (girl school)] | A small school for girls which is beautiful|

Notice that, no **bo** constructs reads from left to right, while with multipole **bo** constructs, one must read from right to left.
