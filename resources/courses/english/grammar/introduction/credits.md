A lot of this course was borrowed from [The Wave Lessons](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons), so credit goes to la klaku, la kribacr, la xalbo, Marenz, and various other Lojbanists who created it.
Updates (including adjustments and new content) and interactive exercises were made by me (Jonathan) and [other contributors](https://github.com/jqueiroz/lojban.io/graphs/contributors).

The course icon was made by [monkik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/monkik) from [flaticon.com](https://flaticon.com).
