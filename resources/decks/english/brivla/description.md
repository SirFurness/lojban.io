This deck covers the most commonly used brivla in Lojban conversations.
Cards are listed roughly in descending order of usage, so we suggest studying them sequentially.

Many exercises feature the brivla in a real world (ish) contextualized sentence.
<!-- We recommend making an effort to understand these sentences, even when you have already figured out the answer to the corresponding exercise. -->
For these exercises, we recommend making an effort to truly understand the sentence, even if you have already figured out the answer.
This will help develop your comprehension skills.

Before using this deck, we recommend going through the first 12 (ideally 15) lessons of [Getting started with Lojban](/courses/introduction).
Otherwise the contextualized sentences may be difficult to understand, due to an incomplete understanding of the grammar.
Until then, you should be able to practice vocabulary using [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/courses/english/lojban/), [Tinycards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/search?query=lojban), [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/subject/lojban/) and/or [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/lojban).
